Title: Build failed due to Checkstyle violations in IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java

Summary
- CI job "Test JDK 17, ubuntu-latest" failed during the Maven Checkstyle phase with 9 checkstyle violations in src/main/java/com/alibaba/druid/filter/index/IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java.
- The code diff for the change set shows other unrelated edits (SQLASTOutputVisitor, Hive tests) and that IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java was removed in a later patch. The failing build used failed_sha (9003085...), which still contained the style errors.
- Root cause: coding-style issues (trailing whitespace, blank line after opening brace, missing whitespace around colon in for-each, extra semicolon causing an empty statement) introduced or present in IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java triggered the checkstyle plugin and made the build fail.

Build log (relevant excerpts)
- maven-checkstyle-plugin reported: "There are 9 errors reported by Checkstyle 9.2 with src/checkstyle/druid-checks.xml ruleset."
- Errors:
  1. src/main/java/com/alibaba/druid/filter/index/IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java:[34] (regexp) RegexpMultiline: Line has trailing whitespace

  4. src/main/java/com/alibaba/druid/filter/index/IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java:[49] (regexp) RegexpMultiline: Blank line after opening brace
  5. src/main/java/com/alibaba/druid/filter/index/IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java:[83,51] (whitespace) WhitespaceAround: ':' is not preceded with whitespace.

Code diff (high level)
- Files added/modified in this patch series:
  - core/src/main/java/com/alibaba/druid/sql/visitor/SQLASTOutputVisitor.java — small reordering and new printing logic for "SORTED BY" and "INTO n BUCKETS".
  - core/src/test/java/com/alibaba/druid/bvt/sql/hive/HiveCreateTableTest_12.java — adjusted expected output ordering for CREATE TABLE formatting.
  - Added new tests: core/src/test/java/com/alibaba/druid/bvt/sql/hive/issues/Issue5853.java.
- Files removed in the diff:
  - src/main/java/com/alibaba/druid/filter/index/IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java (deleted)
  - src/test/java/com/alibaba/druid/bvt/filter/IllegalSQLIndexFilterExecuteTest.java (deleted)
- Note: The failing CI run used commit failed_sha (9003085...), which still triggered Checkstyle on IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java. The style issues existed in that commit and caused build failure. The deletion appears in a later patch but was not present in the failing CI run.

Root cause analysis (mapping errors to source)
- Trailing whitespace (lines 34, 35, 42)
  - Remove trailing spaces at those lines. Checkstyle flagged those exact lines.
- Blank line after opening brace (lines 49 and 177)
  - Remove the blank line immediately after a '{' (class or method opening). Checkstyle enforces no blank lines after opening brace.
- WhitespaceAround: ':' not preceded with whitespace (lines 83, 96, 117)
  - These match for-each loops in the deleted source, e.g.:
      for (TableStat.Condition condition: conditions) {
    should be:
      for (TableStat.Condition condition : conditions) {
  - Add a space before the colon for every enhanced-for.
- EmptyStatement (line 107,66)
  - The deleted file contains a double semicolon in this statement:
      String[] tableArray = tableInfo.split("\\\\.");;
    Remove the extra semicolon:
      String[] tableArray = tableInfo.split("\\\\.");
- Because the file was present in the failing commit, the checkstyle plugin failed the build. Deleting the file in a later change will avoid this file being checked only if that deletion is included in the commit used by CI. In this run, it was not.

Reproduction steps
1. Checkout the failing commit (sha 9003085f558c134de5b7fe70ac4d54e75898eae6) or ensure the problematic file is present in your workspace.
2. Run:
   ./mvnw -Penable-for-jdk17+,gen-code-cov clean package -B
3. Observe maven-checkstyle-plugin failure with the same 9 violations.

Fix recommendations
- Fix the violations in src/main/java/com/alibaba/druid/filter/index/IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java (or ensure file removal is present in the branch used by CI).
  Specific edits to apply:
  1. Remove trailing whitespace on lines 34, 35, 42 (delete trailing spaces).
  2. Remove blank lines immediately after opening braces at lines 49 and 177.
  3. Add a space before the colon in every enhanced-for loop:
     - Change:
         for (TableStat.Condition condition: conditions) {
       To:
         for (TableStat.Condition condition : conditions) {
     - Do the same for other for-each occurrences (e.g., for (IndexInfo indexInfo: indexInfos) { ... }).
  4. Remove the stray extra semicolon:
     - Change:
         String[] tableArray = tableInfo.split("\\\\.");;
       To:
         String[] tableArray = tableInfo.split("\\\\.");
- Alternatively, if the intent is to remove IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java and its tests fully:
  - Ensure the deletion is included in the commit/PR that CI builds. Re-run CI after push. If deletion is intended, no checkstyle runs against the removed file.
- After applying fixes, locally validate:
  - Run mvn -q -DskipTests -Penable-for-jdk17+,gen-code-cov checkstyle:check to confirm no violations.
  - Run ./mvnw -Penable-for-jdk17+,gen-code-cov clean package -B to reproduce the full build.

Suggested preventative measures
- Add a pre-commit hook (or local git hook) to run checkstyle or run "mvn checkstyle:check" before commit.
- Configure IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse) to show trailing whitespaces and enforce formatting rules consistent with src/checkstyle/druid-checks.xml.
- Add a small CI step early in the pipeline that runs checkstyle alone and fails fast so other long steps are not wasted.

Suggested patch (examples)
- Example fixes (illustrative; line numbers from reported errors):

  - Replace:
      for (TableStat.Condition condition: conditions) {
    With:
      for (TableStat.Condition condition : conditions) {

  - Replace:
      String[] tableArray = tableInfo.split("\\\\.");;
    With:
      String[] tableArray = tableInfo.split("\\\\.");

  - Remove blank lines directly after:
      public class IllegalSQLIndexFilter extends FilterEventAdapter {
      
      private static Map...
    -> remove the blank line so the variable declaration directly follows the opening brace.

Priority and impact
- Priority: high. The Checkstyle failure stops the CI pipeline and prevents further build artifacts and downstream testing from running.
- Impact: blocked CI and PRs until style issues are fixed or the offending file is properly removed in the built commit.

If you want, I can:
- Produce an exact patch file for IllegalSQLIndexFilter.java fixing each violation (based on the deleted file content included in the code diff).
- Or, verify that deleting the file in the branch being built (and re-running CI) fixes the failure.
