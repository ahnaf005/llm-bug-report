Title
Missing Javadoc on SerializedConstant causes Maven build (checkstyle) failure

Summary
A recent change introduced/left the class net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.SerializedConstant without a Javadoc comment, which violates the project's Checkstyle rules. The Maven build fails during the maven-checkstyle-plugin:check goal for the byte-buddy-dep module with "Missing a Javadoc comment." The provided code diff includes the required Javadoc and a unit test — applying that patch fixes the build.

Steps to reproduce
1. Checkout the failing commit (sha reported in build log): cea264e688cf165d0693da9721eac5781905d3ee (or the tree state used by the failing build).
2. In the repository root run:
   mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
3. Observe the build failure during the checkstyle phase for module byte-buddy-dep.

Triggering input / conditions
- Source file missing a Javadoc comment for class SerializedConstant:
  byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/implementation/bytecode/constant/SerializedConstant.java
- Project uses maven-checkstyle-plugin (Checkstyle 6.11.2) with a ruleset that requires Javadoc for classes.
- Running the Maven build with default lifecycle and checkstyle enabled.

Expected behavior
Maven build should complete successfully (or at least fail for legitimate code/test errors). If Checkstyle is configured to require Javadoc comments, classes must provide them; builds should only fail when there is a real code/style violation. In this case, if a Javadoc requirement is intended, the expectation is that the class has a Javadoc and the check passes.

Observed behavior
Maven fails during the checkstyle check with one error:
- Checkstyle reports "Missing a Javadoc comment." at SerializedConstant.java line 14.
- Build fails with:
  Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (default) on project byte-buddy-dep: Failed during checkstyle execution: There is 1 error reported by Checkstyle 6.11.2 with checkstyle.xml ruleset.

Relevant build log excerpts / stack traces
- Checkstyle error location:
  /home/travis/build/raphw/byte-buddy/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/implementation/bytecode/constant/SerializedConstant.java:14: error: Missing a Javadoc comment.
- Final Maven failure summary (repeated on retries):
  [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (default) on project byte-buddy-dep: Failed during checkstyle execution: There is 1 error reported by Checkstyle 6.11.2 with checkstyle.xml ruleset. -> [Help 1]
- Maven exit message:
  The command "mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V" failed 3 times.

Relevant code snippets (from diff)
- Patch added a Javadoc comment above the class (fix):
  --- a/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/implementation/bytecode/constant/SerializedConstant.java
  +++ b/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/implementation/bytecode/constant/SerializedConstant.java

  +/**

   public class SerializedConstant implements StackManipulation {

- Patch also added unit tests (new file):
  byte-buddy-dep/src/test/java/net/bytebuddy/implementation/bytecode/constant/SerializedConstantTest.java
  (contains tests for null handling, serialization behavior and object-property assertions)

Patches / Suggested fixes
- The code diff already includes the recommended fix: add a Javadoc comment at the class declaration. That resolves the Checkstyle violation.
  - Patch excerpt (applies to file byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/.../SerializedConstant.java):
    /**
     * A constant that represents a value in its serialized form.
     */
    public class SerializedConstant implements StackManipulation {

- Alternative fixes (if you prefer to change the policy instead of the code):
  - Update Checkstyle configuration (checkstyle.xml) to not require Javadoc for this class or for all package-private or internal classes (if applicable).
  - Add a Checkstyle suppression for this file (not recommended for project-wide style rules).
  - If the class is intentionally undocumented and you do not want Javadoc, mark the class with a suppression annotation or configure checkstyle suppression filter appropriately.

Notes / Recommendation
- The simplest and most consistent fix is the one already included in the diff: add a short Javadoc comment above the class (as done in the patch).
- Also verify the new test (SerializedConstantTest.java) compiles and passes (the build invoked with -DskipTests=true skipped tests, but the test addition is useful for coverage). If teams desire to keep builds faster, ensure tests are valid and consistent with CI settings.
- After applying the patch, rerun:
  mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
  to confirm the checkstyle error is resolved.

If you want, I can:
- Produce the exact git commands to create a branch with the fix and push it, or
- Generate a minimal checkstyle suppression snippet to apply temporarily while reviewing whether the Javadoc rule should be relaxed.
