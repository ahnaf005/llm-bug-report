Title
- Compilation failure: possible lossy conversion from double to float in MesosTaskStatisticsObject.java

Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository and checkout the failing commit/branch (example from the build log: commit e8fd6892f326916c3da9359a216a7e0e06cd4f47 on branch hs_qa).
2. Ensure JDK 8 is in use (build log used Oracle JDK8).
3. Run Maven build: mvn -Pbuild-swagger-documentation -DskipTests=true -B -q -fae install
4. Observe the compile errors from the maven-compiler-plugin during compilation of the SingularityBase module.

Triggering Input / Conditions
- Building with Java 8 and Maven (maven-compiler-plugin) on the code that contains MesosTaskStatisticsObject.java.
- The code attempts to assign double values to float fields (or otherwise perform an implicit narrowing conversion double -> float) without an explicit cast.

Expected Behavior
- The project should compile cleanly under the configured JDK/Maven environment.
- No implicit narrowing assignments should remain; code should either use matching types (double) or explicit casts where safe and intended.

Observed Behavior (from build log)
- Maven compile fails with three compilation errors in MesosTaskStatisticsObject.java indicating incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to float:
  - /home/travis/build/HubSpot/Singularity/SingularityBase/src/main/java/com/hubspot/mesos/json/MesosTaskStatisticsObject.java:[60,12] incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to float
  - /home/travis/build/HubSpot/Singularity/SingularityBase/src/main/java/com/hubspot/mesos/json/MesosTaskStatisticsObject.java:[64,12] incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to float
  - /home/travis/build/HubSpot/Singularity/SingularityBase/src/main/java/com/hubspot/mesos/json/MesosTaskStatisticsObject.java:[68,12] incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to float

Relevant Code Snippets (inferred from error — actual diff not provided)
- The provided CODE DIFF content appears to be an HTTP 404 JSON response (no code diff available):
  {
    "_error": {
      "code": 404,
      "message": "The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again."
    },
    "_status": "ERR"
  }
- The compiler errors indicate code similar to the following pattern (this is an inferred example showing the problematic assignments):

  // MesosTaskStatisticsObject.java (inferred)
  public class MesosTaskStatisticsObject {
      // fields declared as float
      private float someMetric1;
      private float someMetric2;
      private float someMetric3;

      // constructor (or setters) assign double-returning values to float fields
      public MesosTaskStatisticsObject(MesosStats stats) {
          this.someMetric1 = stats.getSomeMetric1(); // getSomeMetric1() returns double -> compile error
          this.someMetric2 = stats.getSomeMetric2(); // double -> float
          this.someMetric3 = stats.getSomeMetric3(); // double -> float
      }
  }

Suggested Fixes / Patches
There are two broad correct approaches. Choose one based on desired numeric precision and API design:

1) Change the field types to double (recommended if original source values are double-precision):
- Rationale: avoids narrowing conversions and preserves precision. If upstream Mesos / library returns doubles, representing them as double in your data object is consistent.

Example patch (replace float with double):
- Before:
  private float someMetric1;
  private float someMetric2;
  private float someMetric3;

- After:
  private double someMetric1;
  private double someMetric2;
  private double someMetric3;

- Also update getters/setters/signatures to return/accept double.

2) Keep float fields but perform explicit casts where the narrowing is intentional:
- Rationale: if you deliberately want to store as float to save memory or match a pre-existing API, you must explicitly cast double -> float to satisfy Java's type system.
- Be aware this may lose precision.

Example patch (add casts):
  this.someMetric1 = (float) stats.getSomeMetric1();
  this.someMetric2 = (float) stats.getSomeMetric2();
  this.someMetric3 = (float) stats.getSomeMetric3();

3) Alternative: modify the source of the values so they return float instead of double (less preferred unless you control that API and it's logically float).

Additional Recommendations
- Update unit tests / API docs if changing types (float -> double) to avoid downstream surprises.
- If this error arose after an upgrade (e.g., Mesos client now returns double), prefer double in the model to match upstream types.
- Since the code diff supplied in the report was a 404 JSON, ensure the code changes/PR includes the actual diff and the CI job references the correct file paths/PR. The missing diff makes automated review harder.

Notes
- The build log shows the environment used (Oracle JDK8, Maven 3.2.5). The error is a Java compile-time type error and is deterministic; reproducing it requires building the referenced commit under JDK8.
- The actual file MesosTaskStatisticsObject.java and exact variable names/line numbers exist in the repository; apply one of the suggested fixes to the lines reported (60, 64, 68) to resolve the compilation errors.
