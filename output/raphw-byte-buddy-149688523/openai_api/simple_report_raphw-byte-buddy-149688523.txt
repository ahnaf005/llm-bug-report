Title
- Build failure: Checkstyle errors — missing Javadoc comments in FieldProxy.Binder constructors (byte-buddy-dep)

Summary
- The Maven build fails in the byte-buddy-dep module due to Checkstyle reporting two "Missing a Javadoc comment." errors in byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/implementation/bind/annotation/FieldProxy.java.
- Build log shows the checkstyle failure at two lines (225 and 229). The included code diff attempted to add Javadoc for Binder constructors, but the CI build still failed.

Environment (from build log)
- CI: Travis CI (container-based)
- OS: Ubuntu 12.04 precise (Linux 3.13.0-29/40)
- JDK: oraclejdk8 (1.8.0_101)
- Maven: 3.2.5
- Checkstyle plugin version: checkstyle 6.11.2 (maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17)
- Module: byte-buddy-dep
- Failed commit: 14f2faaea3331b0f0ce5cbe2f53d2b7aaf48015a

Observed behavior
- Maven build fails with:
  [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (default) on project byte-buddy-dep: Failed during checkstyle execution: There are 2 errors reported by Checkstyle 6.11.2 with checkstyle.xml ruleset.
- Checkstyle output (excerpt):
  /home/travis/build/raphw/byte-buddy/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/implementation/bind/annotation/FieldProxy.java:225:9: error: Missing a Javadoc comment.
  /home/travis/build/raphw/byte-buddy/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/implementation/bind/annotation/FieldProxy.java:229:9: error: Missing a Javadoc comment.

Relevant code diff (provided)
- The diff shows additions in FieldProxy.java around the Binder constructors. The new Javadoc blocks added in the patch are:

  /**
   * Creates a new binder for a {@link FieldProxy} in simplex mode.
   *
   * @param getterMethod The getter method.
   * @param setterMethod The setter method.
   */
  protected Binder(MethodDescription.InDefinedShape getterMethod, MethodDescription.InDefinedShape setterMethod) {
      this(new FieldResolver.Factory.Simplex(getterMethod, setterMethod));
  }

  /**
   * Creates a new binder for a {@link FieldProxy} in duplex mode.
   *
   * @param proxyType    The proxy type.
   * @param getterMethod The getter method.
   * @param setterMethod The setter method.
   */
  protected Binder(TypeDescription proxyType, MethodDescription.InDefinedShape getterMethod, MethodDescription.InDefinedShape setterMethod) {
      this(new FieldResolver.Factory.Duplex(proxyType, getterMethod, setterMethod));
  }

Root cause analysis
- Checkstyle is configured to require Javadoc comments for non-private methods/constructors. The build log shows Checkstyle complaining that the two protected constructors of FieldProxy.Binder are missing Javadoc.
- The patch in the CODE DIFF appears to add Javadoc comments for those constructors; therefore one of the following is true:
  1. The commit tested by CI (failed_sha) does not contain the Javadoc additions (i.e., the diff shown is not the code that CI built). The failing SHA indicates the commit tested might not include the fix — ensure the commit/branch pushed to CI includes the new comments.
  2. The Javadoc comments added in the commit are malformed (e.g., wrong comment delimiters, stray characters, encoding issues) and are therefore not recognized by Checkstyle as valid Javadoc. Checkstyle looks for /** ... */ specifically.
  3. Line numbers in the build log refer to a slightly different file version, so the reported lines do not match the newest edits.
- Most likely: the failing commit used for the build doesn't include the Javadoc, or the Javadoc was added in the wrong place/format, so Checkstyle still sees the constructors without Javadoc.

Immediate fix (recommended)
1. Verify local copy
   - Pull the failing commit (14f2faa...) or check out the branch exactly as CI does and inspect FieldProxy.java around the Binder constructors to confirm whether the Javadoc is present.
2. If Javadoc is missing or malformed, add/repair it exactly as a proper Javadoc block, e.g.:

   /**
    * Creates a new binder for a {@link FieldProxy} in simplex mode.
    *
    * @param getterMethod The getter method.
    * @param setterMethod The setter method.
    */
   protected Binder(MethodDescription.InDefinedShape getterMethod,
                    MethodDescription.InDefinedShape setterMethod) {
       this(new FieldResolver.Factory.Simplex(getterMethod, setterMethod));
   }

   /**
    * Creates a new binder for a {@link FieldProxy} in duplex mode.
    *
    * @param proxyType    The proxy type.
    * @param getterMethod The getter method.
    * @param setterMethod The setter method.
    */
   protected Binder(TypeDescription proxyType,
                    MethodDescription.InDefinedShape getterMethod,
                    MethodDescription.InDefinedShape setterMethod) {
       this(new FieldResolver.Factory.Duplex(proxyType, getterMethod, setterMethod));
   }

   Notes:
   - Use /** ... */ (not /* ... */ or //).
   - Ensure @param names match parameter names exactly.
   - Ensure file encoding is UTF-8 and no stray invisible characters exist before /**.
   - Confirm no other constructors/methods in the file also lack Javadoc per Checkstyle rules.
3. Run the Checkstyle check locally to validate before pushing:
   - mvn checkstyle:check
   - Or run the full build to validate: mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
4. Push the corrected commit and re-run CI.

Alternative / temporary options (not recommended for permanent solution)
- If this is part of an in-progress change and you want to get CI green immediately, you can:
  - Add the proper Javadoc and re-run build (preferred).
  - (Not recommended) Relax Checkstyle rules or disable the plugin temporarily — this reduces code quality and should be avoided.

How to reproduce locally
- Clone the repo and checkout the same failing SHA/branch:
  git clone https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy.git
  cd byte-buddy
  git checkout 14f2faaea3331b0f0ce5cbe2f53d2b7aaf48015a
- Run:
  mvn -B -V install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
- Observe identical Checkstyle errors on FieldProxy.java at lines reported in CI.

Action items for the author / maintainer
- Confirm whether the provided CODE DIFF was actually included in the commit tested by CI. If not, push the commit with the Javadoc additions.
- If the Javadoc is present, ensure it is formatted correctly (/** ... */), matches parameter names exactly, and has no encoding/whitespace issues that could cause Checkstyle to ignore it.
- Re-run mvn checkstyle:check locally and then redeploy to CI.

- CODE DIFF: shows intended Javadoc blocks to be added for the two constructors (see "patches" in provided diff).

If you want, I can:
- Produce a small patch file you can apply to FieldProxy.java that adds the two Javadoc blocks in exact form and passes Checkstyle.
- Run through a checklist of other files that may fail the same Checkstyle rule to proactively fix them.
