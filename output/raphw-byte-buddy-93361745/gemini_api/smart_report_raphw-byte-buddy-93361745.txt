## Bug Report: Checkstyle `MissingSwitchDefault` Violations Cause Build Failure

### 1. Title:
Maven Build Fails Due to Checkstyle `MissingSwitchDefault` Violations

### 2. Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Clone the `raphw/byte-buddy` repository.
2.  Checkout the specific commit: `664f65ccf2fc5b9d9c977f254cff39aade0a7734`.
3.  Execute the Maven build command: `mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V`

### 3. Triggering Input:
The build is triggered by the presence of `switch` statements in the `byte-buddy-dep` module's source code that do not include a `default` clause. The `checkstyle.xml` configuration, at the time of the failing build, includes the `MissingSwitchDefault` rule, which flags these omissions as errors.

### 4. Expected Behavior:
The Maven build should complete successfully, indicating that all code quality checks (including Checkstyle) pass, and the project artifacts are installed.

### 5. Observed Behavior:
The Maven build consistently fails during the `maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check` goal for the `Byte Buddy (with dependencies)` module (`byte-buddy-dep`). The failure is caused by two `MissingSwitchDefault` errors reported by Checkstyle 6.11.2, indicating `switch` statements without a `default` clause. The build attempts to retry twice but fails each time with the same errors.

**Specific error messages from the build log:**
```
/home/travis/build/raphw/byte-buddy/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/asm/TypeConstantAdjustment.java:122:21: error: switch without "default" clause.
/home/travis/build/raphw/byte-buddy/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/dynamic/scaffold/TypeWriter.java:2343:25: error: switch without "default" clause.
```

### 6. Relevant Code Snippets:
The build log indicates the problematic files and lines:
*   `net/bytebuddy/asm/TypeConstantAdjustment.java` at line 122, column 21.
*   `net/bytebuddy/dynamic/scaffold/TypeWriter.java` at line 2343, column 25.

The `checkstyle.xml` configuration that caused the failure (before the provided patch was applied) included the `MissingSwitchDefault` module:
```xml
<!-- Excerpt from checkstyle.xml (before patch) -->
<module name="EmptyStatement"/>
<module name="EqualsHashCode"/>
<module name="IllegalInstantiation"/>
<module name="MissingSwitchDefault"/> <!-- This rule was active and caused the build failure -->
<module name="SimplifyBooleanExpression"/>
<module name="SimplifyBooleanReturn"/>
```

### 7. Stack Traces:
The primary error message from the Maven build log is:
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (default) on project byte-buddy-dep: Failed during checkstyle execution: There are 2 errors reported by Checkstyle 6.11.2 with checkstyle.xml ruleset. -> [Help 1]
[ERROR] 
[ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.
[ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.

[ERROR] After correcting the problems, you can resume the build with the command
[ERROR]   mvn <goals> -rf :byte-buddy-dep
```

### 8. Patches / Suggested Fixes:
The provided code diff contains a patch that resolves this issue by removing the `MissingSwitchDefault` rule from the `checkstyle.xml` configuration.
