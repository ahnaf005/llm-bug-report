2023-05-05T15:32:03.1249765Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1251383Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1252942Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1258861Z 
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1260310Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1262028Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1263386Z 
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1264698Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1282208Z 
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1283637Z Or undo this operation with:
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1284972Z 
2023-05-05T15:32:03.1286202Z   git switch -
