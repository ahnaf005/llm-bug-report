Title: CI failure — NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined during test collection

Summary
- CI (GitHub Actions) running pytest on Python 3.10 fails during test collection with 4 errors:
  NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined
- Failure originates from riscemu/types/binary_data_memory_section.py where Optional is used in a class attribute annotation but typing.Optional was not imported.
- The repository diff shows the correct fix (adding "from typing import Optional") was made in the branch, but the failing CI run corresponds to a commit that did not include that import (failed_sha: 6ec6e513...).

Environment (from build log)
- GitHub Actions runner: Ubuntu 22.04.2
- Python: 3.10.11
- pytest: 7.3.1
- Error occurred during test collection (no tests executed)

Failure details / Stack trace (relevant excerpt)
- Test collection aborts with 4 identical errors. One representative stack trace snippet:

  File "riscemu/types/binary_data_memory_section.py", line <class body>:
    class BinaryDataMemorySection(MemorySection):
  File "riscemu/types/binary_data_memory_section.py", line 19, in BinaryDataMemorySection
    flags: Optional[MemoryFlags] = None,
  NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined

- pytest summary:
  ERROR test/test_helpers.py - NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined
  ERROR test/test_integers.py - NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined
  ERROR test/test_isa.py - NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined
  ERROR test/test_tokenizer.py - NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined

Root cause
- The code uses Optional in type annotations in riscemu/types/binary_data_memory_section.py but does not import Optional from the typing module, causing NameError at import/collection time.
- Since the failing commit (failed_sha) did not include the import, importing the package fails immediately, preventing pytest from discovering tests.

Files/lines implicated
- riscemu/types/binary_data_memory_section.py
  - Problem line (from the traceback): flags: Optional[MemoryFlags] = None
  - Missing import: Optional from typing

Patch (shown in code diff)
- The repo diff includes the fix that adds the missing import at the top of riscemu/types/binary_data_memory_section.py:

  + from typing import Optional
  from . import (
      MemorySection,
      InstructionContext,
      ...

- This is the correct minimal fix.

Other changes in the diff (not related to the failure)
- Small README addition (link).
- Minor formatting change in riscemu/__main__.py (trailing comma added to an argparse.add_argument call). These are unrelated to the NameError.

Steps to reproduce locally
1. Checkout the commit that produced the failure (failed_sha: 6ec6e5130e8fbaca8b151fc7c5308b5a40aad2c8).
2. Create a virtualenv and install dev requirements:
   - python -m venv .venv
   - source .venv/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements.txt
3. Run pytest:
   - pytest -q
4. Observe import-time NameError during collection as above.

Recommended fix
- Ensure riscemu/types/binary_data_memory_section.py contains:
  from typing import Optional
  at the top of the file (before use). The patch in the provided diff is the exact fix.

Additional recommendations / improvements
- Add a small smoke test that imports the top-level package (riscemu) to catch import-time errors quickly, e.g. a test that simply does "import riscemu".
- Consider running a quick "import check" step in CI before running the full pytest suite (e.g., python -c "import riscemu").
- Add static type checking (mypy) or run a linter in CI to catch missing typing imports earlier.
- If using from __future__ import annotations (deferred annotations), names in annotations are not evaluated at runtime — that would help avoid runtime NameErrors for some cases. Decide whether to use that project-wide.
- When changing type annotations, prefer fully qualifying as typing.Optional or ensure necessary typing imports are present.

Action items
- Merge the commit that adds "from typing import Optional" (this is already present in the code diff).
- Re-run CI for the branch (the run that failed was for failed_sha). After merging/applying the fix, the import errors should be resolved and pytest can continue.

References
- Build log indicates the failing commit: failed_sha = 6ec6e5130e8f...
- Code diff shows the fix adding "from typing import Optional" to riscemu/types/binary_data_memory_section.py.

If you want, I can:
- Produce a minimal patch/PR description for merging the fix,
- Suggest a smoke-test to add to the test suite,
- Run through any other related files to verify typing imports are consistent.
