Title
- Unit test failure after updating bundled Logback jars from 1.3.14 -> 1.3.15

Summary
- The CI build fails (maven surefire) due to one unit test: net.nikr.eve.jeveasset.lib.LibTest.testLibs. The test reports that LibraryManager now lists logback-core-1.3.15.jar and logback-classic-1.3.15.jar as "added" and that 1.3.14 variants are "removed". This is caused by a small change in LibraryManager that updates the shipped library file names to .1.3.15. The test expects the old names (1.3.14) and fails with an assertion.

Environment
- Project: GoldenGnu/jeveassets
- CI: GitHub Actions runner ubuntu-22.04 (Java 17, Maven)
- Build command: mvn -B package --file pom.xml -P skip-online-tests

- Passing sha (previous): 38f5c01daff3f7c5a43fa5871f820f063f6cea29

Code diff that introduced change
- File: src/main/java/net/nikr/eve/jeveasset/LibraryManager.java
- Change (lines shown):
  - Old:
    files.add("logback-core-1.3.14.jar");
    files.add("logback-classic-1.3.14.jar");
  - New:
    files.add("logback-core-1.3.15.jar");
    files.add("logback-classic-1.3.15.jar");

Root cause
- The only change in the patch is to update the hard-coded library filenames in LibraryManager to the newer Logback version (1.3.15). The unit test LibTest.testLibs asserts the exact set/names of these bundled jar files. Because the LibraryManager now reports 1.3.15 but the test expects 1.3.14, the assertion fails.
- There is no other failing stack trace indicating runtime errors; the test is a mismatch between test expectation and the updated source.

Observed behavior
- CI unit test LibTest.testLibs fails with an AssertionError listing the added and removed jar filenames (1.3.15 added; 1.3.14 removed).
- The build stops as surefire treats the failed test as build failure.

Expected behavior
- Either:
  - LibraryManager and project should consistently use the Logback version declared in build dependencies (if intentionally upgraded to 1.3.15), and tests should be updated accordingly; OR
  - If upgrading was not intended, LibraryManager should continue to reference the expected 1.3.14 filenames.

Impact
- CI builds fail preventing merges / releases.
- Any code relying on the LibraryManager static list of libraries could be affected in packaging/run-time if the actual dependency jars in other parts of the build are not aligned with this change.

Recommendations / Fixes
Option A — Update tests to accept the new version (preferred if bump to 1.3.15 was intentional)
1. Update test expectation in net.nikr.eve.jeveasset.lib.LibTest to expect logback-core-1.3.15.jar and logback-classic-1.3.15.jar instead of 1.3.14.
2. Better: make test version-agnostic (future-proof):
   - Instead of asserting exact filenames, assert that there exists a logback-core-*.jar and a logback-classic-*.jar entry (use regex).
   - Or assert that the filenames match pattern "logback-(core|classic)-1\\.3\\.[0-9]+\\.jar" or simply check prefix "logback-core-" and "logback-classic-".
   - Example pseudo-code change (conceptual):
     - Replace assertFalse(mismatch) with:
       boolean hasCore = files.stream().anyMatch(f -> f.matches("logback-core-1\\.3\\.[0-9]+\\.jar"));
       boolean hasClassic = files.stream().anyMatch(f -> f.matches("logback-classic-1\\.3\\.[0-9]+\\.jar"));
       assertTrue("Logback jars present", hasCore && hasClassic);

Option B — Revert LibraryManager change (if bump unintentional)
1. Revert the two lines in LibraryManager back to 1.3.14:
   files.add("logback-core-1.3.14.jar");
   files.add("logback-classic-1.3.14.jar");
2. Ensure the packaged libs and pom dependencies match.

Option C — Keep both versions (not recommended long-term)
- Temporarily include both versions in the list to preserve test expectations while other parts are migrated. This is messy and should be avoided unless co-existence is required.

Suggested immediate patch (if upgrade intended)
- Update LibTest to be version-tolerant. Minimal change example (Java pseudo-code snippet):

  // Old assertion (strict):
  // assertFalse("Unexpected difference", !expected.equals(actual));

  // New check (version-agnostic):
  boolean corePresent = actual.stream().anyMatch(s -> s.startsWith("logback-core-"));
  boolean classicPresent = actual.stream().anyMatch(s -> s.startsWith("logback-classic-"));
  assertTrue("Both logback-core and logback-classic must be present", corePresent && classicPresent);

Commands to reproduce locally
1. Checkout the failing commit/branch:
   git checkout dependabot/maven/ch.qos.logback-logback-core-1.3.15
2. Run tests (same as CI):
   mvn -B test
   or to run only failing test:
   mvn -Dtest=net.nikr.eve.jeveasset.lib.LibTest test

Verification after fix
- Re-run the specific test:
  mvn -Dtest=net.nikr.eve.jeveasset.lib.LibTest test
- If green, re-run full test suite (mvn test) on CI.

Additional notes / observations from build log
- The build log contains many informational "Fatal Error: Content is not allowed in prolog." messages from XML parsing during BackupTest — those tests appear to expect and handle corrupted XML cases and are ultimately passing (the test harness treats them as expected). They are not the cause of build failure.
- The root and only failing test is LibTest.testLibs; fix should be limited to test or LibraryManager change as explained.

Risk & follow-up
- Low-risk: updating the test to accept the new version is simple and correct if the dependency bump to 1.3.15 is intended and dependencies/poms are aligned.
- Medium-risk: If the project still packages 1.3.14 artifacts anywhere (or the runtime expects 1.3.14), changing LibraryManager to 1.3.15 without updating packaging will cause runtime/packaging inconsistencies. Verify that pom.xml / dependency management was updated to 1.3.15 or that the build artifacts include the 1.3.15 jars.

Suggested next steps
1. Confirm whether updating Logback to 1.3.15 was intentional (check pom.xml / dependency updates or dependabot PR).
2. If yes: update LibTest to be version-agnostic or to expect 1.3.15; run full test suite in CI.
3. If no: revert LibraryManager to 1.3.14 or coordinate an intended version bump across code and test expectations.

Files/lines changed (from diff)
- src/main/java/net/nikr/eve/jeveasset/LibraryManager.java
  - files.add("logback-core-1.3.14.jar"); -> files.add("logback-core-1.3.15.jar");
  - files.add("logback-classic-1.3.14.jar"); -> files.add("logback-classic-1.3.15.jar");

If you want, I can:
- Produce a ready-to-apply patch for LibTest to make it version-independent.
- Produce the revert patch for LibraryManager (back to 1.3.14).
- Inspect pom.xml to confirm the declared logback version and suggest alignment steps.
