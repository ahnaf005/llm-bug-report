Title
- Build fails due to Checkstyle "TodoComment" violation in MantaMultipartManager.java (leftover "TODO:" comment)

Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository and check out the patch/branch containing the diff in this report.
2. From the project root run the Maven install that runs Checkstyle:
   mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
3. Observe the build failure during the maven-checkstyle-plugin:check phase.

Triggering Input / Conditions
- The source file java-manta-client/src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java contains a single-line comment matching the forbidden format "TODO:" which triggers the Checkstyle rule (TodoComment).
- Checkstyle is executed as part of the Maven build (maven-checkstyle-plugin), so the presence of that comment causes the build to fail.

Expected Behavior
- The maven build should pass Checkstyle (or at least not fail because of a TODO comment).
- The code changes in the diff should be validated/compiled and the build should proceed to install without Checkstyle violations.

Observed Behavior
- The Maven build stops with a Checkstyle error:
  [ERROR] src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java:[641] (misc) TodoComment: Comment matches to-do format 'TODO:'.
- Maven reports a MojoFailureException from maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check and the build fails (3 retry attempts attempted, each fails).

Relevant Build Log / Stack Lines
- Key error lines from the build log:
  [ERROR] src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java:[641] (misc) TodoComment: Comment matches to-do format 'TODO:'.
  [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (checkstyle) on project java-manta-client: You have 1 Checkstyle violation. -> [Help 1]
  (Maven suggestions for -e and -X are printed and the build stops)

Relevant Code Snippets (from diff)
- File: java-manta-client/src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java
  Around the area where Checkstyle flagged the TODO (note the exact text causing the Checkstyle rule to match):
  jobExecText.append("mget -q ");
  // TODO: Validate parts and match up etags with path
  List<MantaMultipartUploadTuple> missingTuples = new ArrayList<>();
  final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
  partsStream.sorted().forEach(part -> {
      if (count.incrementAndGet() > MAX_PARTS) {
          String msg = String.format("Too many multipart parts specified [%d]. The maximum number of parts is %d", MAX_PARTS, count.get());
          throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
      }

      final MantaMultipartUploadPart o = listing.get(part.getEtag());

      if (o != null) {
          jobExecText.append(o.getObjectPath()).append(" ");
      } else {
          missingTuples.add(part);
      }
  });

Why this fails
- The project enforces a Checkstyle rule that forbids TODO-style comments matching the pattern 'TODO:' (the check is named TodoComment).
- The added comment line contains "TODO:" and therefore violates the style check, failing the build.

Patches / Suggested Fixes
Two viable fixes (pick one):

1) Remove or reword the offending TODO comment (preferred quick fix)
- Replace the single line:
  // TODO: Validate parts and match up etags with path
- With a neutral comment that does not match the strict "TODO:" pattern, for example:
  // Validate parts and match up etags with path
  or
  // NOTE: Validate parts and match up etags with path (validation implemented below)
- Minimal patch (unified diff fragment):
  --- a/java-manta-client/src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java
  +++ b/java-manta-client/src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java
  @@ -... +... @@
  -        // TODO: Validate parts and match up etags with path
  +        // Validate parts and match up etags with path

2) Implement the validation (if the TODO indicates missing work) and remove the TODO comment after implementation
- If the TODO signals missing behavior that still needs to be implemented (rather than a leftover comment), implement the required validation and remove the "TODO:" comment. The diff already shows code that appears to perform matching between requested parts and listing by etag; if that is complete, just remove/reword the comment.

3) (Alternative) Adjust Checkstyle rules (not recommended for small change)
- Modify the Checkstyle configuration to relax the TodoComment check. This is heavier-weight and changes project policy; only appropriate if TODO comments are allowed by project conventions.

Suggested immediate action
- Edit java-manta-client/src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java to remove or reword the "TODO:" comment.
- Run mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true locally to confirm the Checkstyle error is resolved.

Notes / Additional Context
- The rest of the diff introduces a new exception class (MantaMultipartException) and other code changes unrelated to the Checkstyle violation; once the TODO comment is removed/reworded the build should progress to the next phases (unless other style/compile errors exist).
- The build log shows the maven-checkstyle-plugin 2.17 is used; its default rule for TodoComment rejects comments matching the 'TODO:' pattern.
