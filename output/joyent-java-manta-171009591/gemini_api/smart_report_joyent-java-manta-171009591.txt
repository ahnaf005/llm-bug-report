## Bug Report: Checkstyle TodoComment Violation in MantaMultipartManager.java

### 1. Title
Build Fails Due to Checkstyle TodoComment Violation in `MantaMultipartManager.java`

### 2. Steps to Reproduce
1.  Clone the `joyent/java-manta` repository.
2.  Checkout the `FETCH_HEAD` for pull request #120 (corresponding to `e5c53bf1f1df1d34783f390562179d6a48292f95`).
3.  Execute the Maven install command: `mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V`

### 3. Triggering Input
The presence of a `TODO:` comment at line 641 in the file `src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java` that violates the Checkstyle `TodoComment` rule.

### 4. Expected Behavior
The Maven build should complete successfully, indicating that all compilation, dependency resolution, and code quality checks (including Checkstyle) have passed without errors. Specifically, no `TodoComment` violations should be reported.

### 5. Observed Behavior
The Maven `install` command fails during the Checkstyle plugin execution. The build log reports a `TodoComment` violation in `src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java` at line 641. The build retries twice, failing each time, and ultimately stops.

**Error Message:**
```
[ERROR] src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java:[641] (misc) TodoComment: Comment matches to-do format 'TODO:'.
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (checkstyle) on project java-manta-client: You have 1 Checkstyle violation. -> [Help 1]
```

### 6. Relevant Code Snippets
The build log indicates a `TodoComment` violation at line 641 of `MantaMultipartManager.java`. The provided code diff shows that a `TODO:` comment was present at the *original* line 641 and was intended to be removed.

*(Note: The build log reports the error at line 641 in the *patched* file, while the diff shows the `TODO:` comment being removed from the *original* line 641. This suggests either the diff is incomplete, or the `TODO:` comment was not fully removed, or a new `TODO:` was introduced at the new line 641.)*

### 7. Stack Traces
The build log provides the following error details:
```
[ERROR] src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java:[641] (misc) TodoComment: Comment matches to-do format 'TODO:'.
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (checkstyle) on project java-manta-client: You have 1 Checkstyle violation. -> [Help 1]

### 8. Patches / Suggested Fixes
The provided diff includes a patch that *removes* the `// TODO: Validate parts and match up etags with path` comment from the original line 641. However, since the build still fails with a `TodoComment` violation at line 641, it indicates that either this specific `TODO:` comment was not effectively removed in the final code state, or another `TODO:` comment was introduced at that line.

The suggested fix is to ensure that any `TODO:` comment at line 641 in `src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java` is either completely removed or modified to comply with the project's Checkstyle rules (e.g., by changing its format or adding a ticket reference if required by the rule).
