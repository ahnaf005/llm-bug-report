Title
- Build failure caused by Javadoc error in NFAutorizador31.java (bad use of '>')

Summary
- The Maven build fails during the maven-javadoc-plugin (attach-javadocs) phase with a Javadoc error:
  "error: bad use of '>'" in file src/main/java/com/fincatto/nfe310/classes/NFAutorizador31.java.
- The failure is introduced by an unsafe Javadoc comment containing the substring "=>", which the Javadoc tool interprets as a stray '>' (closing angle bracket) and rejects.
- This blocks artifact creation (attach-javadocs goal) and causes a CI job failure.

Environment / context
- Project: wmixvideo/nfe (commit failed_sha: 12c8a862172bb697d54268935005e83c52e89481)
- CI: Travis (Ubuntu 12.04; Oracle JDK8)
- Maven command used by CI:
  mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dgpg.skip=true --settings ~/settings.xml
- Failing plugin: org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin:2.9.1:jar (attach-javadocs)

- Maven summary:
  [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin:2.9.1:jar (attach-javadocs) on project nfe: MavenReportException: Error while creating archive: Exit code: 1

Failing file and line
- File: src/main/java/com/fincatto/nfe310/classes/NFAutorizador31.java
- Line reported in the javadoc error: ~93 (Javadoc comment line containing "=>")

Steps to reproduce
1. Checkout the commit that produced the failure (failed_sha: 12c8a86...).
2. Run from project root:
   mvn javadoc:jar
   or
   mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dgpg.skip=true
3. Observe the maven-javadoc-plugin failing with "bad use of '>'" pointing to NFAutorizador31.java.

Actual result
- The build fails during the javadoc generation/attach step, failing the entire CI build (BUILD FAILURE). Javadoc generation aborts due to "bad use of '>'".

Expected result
- Javadoc plugin should succeed (generate javadocs and attach them). The build should continue and produce the artifact (jar + sources + javadocs if configured).

Root cause analysis
- The comment line in NFAutorizador31.java contains the literal "=>". The Javadoc tool parses Javadoc comments as HTML (or at least parses tags). A standalone '>' (or sequence that looks like a closing tag without a matching opening '<') triggers a "bad use of '>'" parse error in javadoc (Javadoc treats a raw '>' as stray closing angle bracket).
- The offending comment line is:
    * Links NFC-e segundo site => https://ciranda.me/tsdn/blog-da-tecnospeed/post/como-emitir-nfc-e-na-bahia
  This contains "=>". The '>' character is not escaped or enclosed in {@code} or {@literal}, so javadoc rejects it.
- Many other javadoc warnings are present but are non-fatal; the javadoc parser error is fatal and causes the plugin to exit with code 1.

Code diff (relevant portion)
- The supplied patch shows that the offending comment was changed from:
    * Links NFC-e segundo site => https://...
  to:
    * Links NFC-e segundo site: https://...
- The diff also contains unrelated stylistic changes (reordering an import, adding final to method params, formatting arrays with spaces). Those are not the cause of the javadoc error; the problematic part is the comment operator "=>".

Fixes and recommendations
1. Quick, minimal fix (recommended)
   - Replace the arrow "=>" with a colon ":" or another non-markup character in the Javadoc comment, e.g.:
       * Links NFC-e segundo site: https://...
   - This exactly matches the change in the code diff and will eliminate the javadoc parse error.

2. Robust alternatives (preferred for future-proofing)
   - Escape/encode the '>' using HTML entity:
       * Links NFC-e segundo site =&gt; https://...
     (less preferred than just removing the arrow; still safe)
   - Use Javadoc inline tags to avoid interpretation:
       * Links NFC-e segundo site {@literal =>} https://...
     or
       * Links NFC-e segundo site {@code =>} https://...
   - Wrap the whole line or URL in {@code ...} if you want to preserve special characters:
       * {@code Links NFC-e segundo site => https://...}

3. CI mitigation (temporary)
   - If you need to unblock CI quickly and cannot change source, configure the maven-javadoc-plugin to be non-fatal in CI (not recommended long-term):
     - Use plugin config to set failOnError false for the javadoc plugin (so javadoc errors do not fail build). Example:
         <plugin>
           <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
           <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
           <version>2.9.1</version>
           <configuration>
             <failOnError>false</failOnError>
           </configuration>
         </plugin>
     - Note: this masks documentation errors and is not recommended as a permanent solution.

Patch suggestion
- The code diff already shows the correct fix (replace "=>" with ":"). If you prefer a safer change, apply e.g.:
  - Replace:
    * Links NFC-e segundo site => https://ciranda.me/...
  - With:
    * Links NFC-e segundo site: https://ciranda.me/...
  or:
    * Links NFC-e segundo site {@literal =>} https://ciranda.me/...

Impact / severity
- Severity: High for CI (blocks all builds that generate javadocs).
- Impact: Prevents release/build completion on CI for the affected commit. Developers cannot merge until the javadoc error is fixed (or plugin configured non-fatal).

Additional observations
- The log contains many javadoc warnings (missing @param/@return descriptions). Those are warnings and not fatal, but you might want to address them as part of general code quality.
- The patch also includes reformatting and adding "final" to method parameters and consistent array spacing — these are stylistic and not related to the failure.

Suggested next steps
1. Apply the simple comment fix (replace "=>" with ":" or use {@literal} / {@code}) in NFAutorizador31.java (line ~93).
2. Re-run the CI build (mvn install). Expect javadoc plugin to complete.
3. Optionally:
   - Run mvn javadoc:javadoc locally to confirm no further javadoc errors.
   - Consider running javadoc checks locally as part of developer pre-commit checks to catch these early.
   - If you want to avoid future accidental javadoc markup errors, add a short guideline (or automated check) that advises using {@literal} or {@code} for characters that may be interpreted by javadoc.

- Produce the exact patch file (unified diff) to apply the fix.
- Prepare a one-line CI bypass (temporary pom change) if you need an immediate unblock.
