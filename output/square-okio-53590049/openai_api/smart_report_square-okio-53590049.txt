Title
- Compilation failure: Buffer.java references non-existent SegmentPool.INSTANCE causing build to fail

Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository and checkout the failing commit (seen in the build log):
   - git clone --depth=50 --branch=master git://github.com/square/okio.git
   - cd okio
   - git checkout ffc28d67927d01c2900f3646710e564fc945cd7a
2. Ensure JDK 8 and Maven are available (build log used Oracle JDK8).
3. Run Maven install (as CI did):
   - mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
4. Observe the compilation error during javac compilation.

Triggering Input / Conditions
- The code references SegmentPool.INSTANCE.recycle(segment) in okio/src/main/java/okio/Buffer.java (two locations: around lines ~457 and ~513).
- The class okio.SegmentPool does not define a static field named INSTANCE (so the symbol can't be resolved).
- Build environment: JDK 8, Maven 3.2.5 (as in the build log).

Expected Behavior
- The module should compile successfully. The Buffer class should call whatever API SegmentPool exposes to recycle a Segment (either a static recycle(...) method or a singleton INSTANCE with a recycle(...) method) and compile without unresolved symbol errors.

Observed Behavior
- Maven compile fails with two "cannot find symbol" errors referencing SegmentPool.INSTANCE:
  - /home/travis/build/square/okio/okio/src/main/java/okio/Buffer.java:[457,20] cannot find symbol
    symbol:   variable INSTANCE
    location: class okio.SegmentPool
  - /home/travis/build/square/okio/okio/src/main/java/okio/Buffer.java:[513,20] cannot find symbol
    symbol:   variable INSTANCE
    location: class okio.SegmentPool
- Maven build step fails and the overall build is aborted.

Relevant Build Log / Stack Trace
- Key error output from the build log (trimmed to relevant lines):
  [ERROR] /home/travis/build/square/okio/okio/src/main/java/okio/Buffer.java:[457,20] cannot find symbol
    symbol:   variable INSTANCE
    location: class okio.SegmentPool
  [ERROR] /home/travis/build/square/okio/okio/src/main/java/okio/Buffer.java:[513,20] cannot find symbol
    symbol:   variable INSTANCE
    location: class okio.SegmentPool
- Maven failure summary:

Relevant Code Snippets (from diff)
- Old (failing) code in okio/src/main/java/okio/Buffer.java:
  - At ~line 457:
    SegmentPool.INSTANCE.recycle(segment);
  - At ~line 513:
    SegmentPool.INSTANCE.recycle(segment);

- New (fixed) code in okio/src/main/java/okio/Buffer.java (patch shown in diff):
  - At ~line 457:
    SegmentPool.recycle(segment);
  - At ~line 513:
    SegmentPool.recycle(segment);

Patch / Suggested Fixes
- The provided diff already contains a minimal and correct fix: replace calls to the non-existent INSTANCE field with a static call to SegmentPool.recycle(segment).
  - Change:
    SegmentPool.INSTANCE.recycle(segment);
  - To:
    SegmentPool.recycle(segment);

- Rationale: The SegmentPool API in this codebase exposes a static recycle(Segment) method (or otherwise expects static access). The previous code attempted to call recycle(...) on a non-existent INSTANCE, causing the compiler error. Using the static method matches the current SegmentPool API and resolves the symbol.

Alternative fixes (if code intent differs)
- If the intent was to keep an instance-based API, then modify SegmentPool to provide an INSTANCE singleton:
  - Add in SegmentPool:
    public static final SegmentPool INSTANCE = new SegmentPool();
    // plus non-static recycle method: public void recycle(Segment s) { ... }
  - But this is invasive. The simpler, correct fix per the diff is to call the static recycle method.

Files/Lines Affected
- okio/src/main/java/okio/Buffer.java
  - Two replacements around lines 454–516:
    - The code that previously invoked SegmentPool.INSTANCE.recycle(segment) at two places was changed to SegmentPool.recycle(segment).

Commit / CI Context
- Failing sha referenced by CI: ffc28d67927d01c2900f3646710e564fc945cd7a
- The diff shows the code change that fixes the error; after applying the diff the compilation error should be resolved.

Action Items
1. Apply the change shown in the diff (replace SegmentPool.INSTANCE.recycle(segment) with SegmentPool.recycle(segment) in Buffer.java).
2. Re-run mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true to confirm the module compiles.
3. (Optional) Run unit tests if available to ensure runtime behavior is correct.
4. If there are other references to SegmentPool.INSTANCE elsewhere, update them similarly or add the INSTANCE field in SegmentPool intentionally (but prefer using the existing static API).

Summary
- Cause: Buffer.java calls SegmentPool.INSTANCE but SegmentPool has no INSTANCE field.
- Fix: Use the existing static method SegmentPool.recycle(segment) (patch present in diff).
- Result: After the change build should succeed (the compilation error will be resolved).
