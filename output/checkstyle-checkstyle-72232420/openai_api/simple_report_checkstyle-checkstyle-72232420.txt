Title: Build Failure — Checkstyle header and formatting errors in FileContentsTest.java after patch

Summary
- A recent patch (failed_sha: f1b28dbcdeab04227463ffe9bfb476e891962418) introduced changes to src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/FileContentsTest.java.
- The Maven build fails during the ant-phase-verify Checkstyle run with 3 errors:
  1. Header line(s) in FileContentsTest.java do not match the project header rule.
  2. A whitespace formatting issue: "," is not followed by whitespace (now fixed in diff).
- Build exited with FAILURE; details in the Build Log (Checkstyle reported 3 errors).

Code Diff Summary (patches included in this PR)
1) pom.xml
- Removed one coverage regex entry for TokenTypes (unrelated to the build failure but included in the diff).

2) src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/FileContentsTest.java
- Added license/header block at file top (20 lines added).
- Repaired formatting: changed o.reportCppComment(1,2); to o.reportCppComment(1, 2); (fixes the comma whitespace error).

Observed behavior
- After applying the patch, the Checkstyle ant target reports the header line(s) do not match the expected header and fails the build.
- The comma-whitespace error (line 25:30) reported in the Build Log is addressed by the code diff; however the header mismatch remains and causes the build to fail (2 header-related errors + 1 whitespace error originally = 3 errors).

Root cause analysis
- The Checkstyle header check enforces very strict file header formatting. The build log provides two messages for the first line:
  - One message expects an exact literal header line '////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////'.
  - Another expects a regex '^/{80}$' (i.e., exactly 80 consecutive '/' characters).
- This indicates the header-check is comparing the first line of FileContentsTest.java against the project's canonical header and failing.
- Possible reasons the header check fails, even though a header was added:
  1. The first line in the file is not exactly 80 slash ('/') characters. The added line in the diff looks like '////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////' — but it must be verified that it is exactly 80 '/' characters. If the number is not exactly 80, the '^/{80}$' regex will fail.
  2. There may be a Unicode BOM (Byte Order Mark) or invisible characters at the very start of the file, causing the exact-match to fail.
  3. The file may have leading whitespace or an empty line before the header.
  4. The file line endings may be CRLF vs LF (some header matchers are sensitive; BOM is more likely culprit).
  5. The bottom header (closing line of slashes) must also match the expected pattern in some rules — here the log references only line 1, so top line is the problem.
- The whitespace error (',' not followed by whitespace) was corrected in the patch. Two header-related errors remain.

Recommended fixes
1) Ensure the first line of the file is exactly 80 forward slashes with no leading characters or BOM:
   - Use an authoritative header from other source files in the repo (copy-paste from a file that passes the header-check).
   - Confirm exact length: e.g., run in shell:
     printf '%.0s/' {1..80}; echo
     and paste the produced line as the first line of the file.
   - Verify there are no invisible characters preceding the first slash. Remove BOM if present:
     - In Unix: dos2unix or iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 -c may help remove BOM; or open in an editor and save without BOM.
2) Verify file encoding and line endings:
   - Ensure file is UTF-8 without BOM.
   - Ensure LF line endings (Unix).
   - In Git, ensure .gitattributes (if used) is not altering the file on commit in a way that introduces CRLF or BOM.
3) Ensure the header block exactly matches the project's expected header block:
   - Some projects also check the middle lines (copyright text). If the project's header-check uses a template, copy the entire header block from an existing file that passes.
4) Verify there are no leading blank lines before the header. The header must start at the first character of the file.
5) Locally reproduce and test:
   - Run the same check locally:
     mvn clean -DskipTests -DskipITs -Dpmd.skip=true -Dfindbugs.skip=true -Dcobertura.skip=true verify
   - Or invoke the Ant target that enforces header rules (ant-phase-verify) to get immediate feedback.

Suggested small patch (example)
- Replace the first line with an exact 80-slash line produced by the printf technique above and ensure no BOM:

  (top of file)
  // replace this line with exact 80 slashes (no surrounding quotes)
  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // [rest of license lines...]
  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Note: In the diff you added the license block — keep that block but make sure the topmost and bottommost slash lines are exact and that there is no invisible prefix (BOM) on the file.

Additional notes
- The whitespace error reported at line 25:30 (',' is not followed by whitespace) was fixed in the code diff by changing o.reportCppComment(1,2); to o.reportCppComment(1, 2);. Confirmed done.
- The pom.xml change removing the TokenTypes coverage regex is unrelated to the failing Checkstyle header; however, it may affect coverage gating elsewhere — just be aware.

Severity
- High: build is blocked; CI cannot pass until header checks are satisfied.

Action items
- Developer: adjust FileContentsTest.java header to exactly match project's header template (use a known good file as reference), ensure file encoding without BOM, and verify no leading blank lines.
- Developer: run the same Maven/Ant verify locally to confirm.
- CI: re-run after fix.

If you'd like, I can:
- Provide a ready-to-apply exact header block copied from a passing file in the repository (if you provide one), or
- Suggest commands to detect and remove BOM and convert line endings, or
- Produce a small script that checks the first line length and prints non-printable characters for a failing file.
