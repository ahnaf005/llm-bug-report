Title
- Compilation error in muxer module: test assigns to final static BUFFER in AbstractH26XTrack (cannot assign a value to final variable BUFFER)

Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone repository and checkout the failing commit (sha referenced in build log): ca853b726e61355a8cf5b63f0a3ca6d90e7d5332.
2. From repo root run the same Maven command used in CI:
   mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
   (Note: even with -DskipTests=true, Maven still performs the test-compile phase and will compile test sources.)
3. Observe the build failure during the muxer:test-compile phase.

Triggering Input / Conditions
- The test code in muxer/src/test/java/org/mp4parser/muxer/tracks/H264TrackImplTest.java attempts to assign a new value to AbstractH26XTrack.BUFFER (a static field).
- The production code declares BUFFER as a final static int, causing a compile-time error when test code tries to reassign it.

Expected Behavior
- The project should compile successfully. Either:
  - The BUFFER field should be mutable (non-final) if tests or runtime need to change it; or
  - Tests should not attempt to reassign a final constant; tests should be adapted to work without changing BUFFER (or change strategy to configure buffer limit another way).

Observed Behavior (from build log)
- Maven fails in the muxer module during test compilation with a Java compile error:
  - /home/travis/build/sannies/mp4parser/muxer/src/test/java/org/mp4parser/muxer/tracks/H264TrackImplTest.java:[39,22] cannot assign a value to final variable BUFFER
- The build is retried 3 times and fails each time with the same error.
- Build summary: File Muxer module fails, rest of reactor skipped.

Exact error messages (selected lines from build log)
- [ERROR] /home/travis/build/sannies/mp4parser/muxer/src/test/java/org/mp4parser/muxer/tracks/H264TrackImplTest.java:[39,22] cannot assign a value to final variable BUFFER

- The diff included with the report shows the intended patch: removing the final modifier so the field becomes mutable:
  public static int BUFFER = 65535 << 10;

Patches / Suggested Fixes
1. Patch already prepared (shown in the diff) — remove the final modifier:
   - Change in muxer/src/main/java/org/mp4parser/muxer/tracks/AbstractH26XTrack.java:
     - Old: public static final int BUFFER = 65535 << 10;
     - New: public static int BUFFER = 65535 << 10;
   - This will allow test code that assigns a new value to BUFFER to compile.

2. Alternative (preferred design) fixes to consider instead of making a static mutable field:
   - Avoid mutable public static state:
     - Make BUFFER private static and provide a package-visible or protected setter used only by tests, e.g.:
         private static int BUFFER = 65535 << 10;
         static void setBufferSizeForTests(int size) { BUFFER = size; }
       This keeps the API cleaner while still allowing tests to adjust behavior.
   - Make BUFFER an instance field configurable via constructor:
     - Move BUFFER out of static into instance-level, allow track constructors to accept buffer size. Tests can construct track instances with desired buffer size.
   - Update tests to not assign to the static BUFFER:
     - If BUFFER is intended to be a constant, change H264TrackImplTest so it doesn't attempt to reassign BUFFER. Instead use reflection or constructor/configuration options if the test needs different behavior.
   - Add annotations / comments explaining test-only mutation:
     - If changing to mutable static is chosen, document that this is test-only and consider resetting the static field after tests to avoid interference between tests.

Notes / Recommendations
- The diff included in this report (removal of final) is a minimal change that will fix the compilation error; however, making public static mutable fields is brittle and not recommended as long-term design.
- Prefer either making BUFFER configurable per-instance or adding explicit, controlled test hooks (package-private setter) to avoid exposing mutable global state.
- After applying the patch, re-run the Maven build to ensure there are no other compile-time issues (mvn -DskipTests=true ... still runs test-compile).

Files Mentioned
- Failing test: muxer/src/test/java/org/mp4parser/muxer/tracks/H264TrackImplTest.java (line reported: 39)
- Production file to modify: muxer/src/main/java/org/mp4parser/muxer/tracks/AbstractH26XTrack.java

Summary
- Cause: Tests assign to a static field BUFFER declared final; Java prohibits assigning to final variables.
- Immediate fix (in diff): remove final modifier on BUFFER so assignment is allowed.
- Recommended: Prefer a safer design (inject buffer size via constructor or add test-only setter) rather than exposing a public mutable static field.
