Title
- Unit tests fail due to missing javax.transaction classes after dependency changes in pom.xml (NoClassDefFoundError: javax/transaction/SystemException and related mockit redefinition errors)

Steps to Reproduce
1. Check out the branch/commit that contains the provided code diff.
2. Build and run tests with Java 21 (as in CI): ./mvnw test (or mvn test) on the repo root (psi-probe, run full build which runs psi-probe-core tests).
3. Observe test failures in module psi-probe-core, specifically OpenEjbManagedDatasourceAccessorTest.

Triggering Input / Conditions
- The build under JDK 21.
- The modified pom.xml (the diff shows the project dependencies and plugin changes), specifically:
  - Removal of older openejb/persistence entries and addition of Apache Tomee (tomee.version) + openejb-api/openejb-core/openejb-loader/tomee-jdbc dependencies with exclusions.
  - Removal of the jakarta.persistence dependency block.
- Unit tests exercising OpenEJB-managed datasource accessors (OpenEjbManagedDatasourceAccessorTest) run with JMockit and attempt to retransform/mock classes that reference javax.transaction.* types.

Expected Behavior
- Tests run successfully (all tests in psi-probe-core should pass).
- The OpenEjbManagedDatasourceAccessorTest should execute without ClassNotFound errors for javax.transaction.* types and without mockit instrumentation failures.

Observed Behavior (from build log)
- Multiple test errors in psi-probe-core:
  - java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/transaction/SystemException
    - Occurs early in OpenEjbManagedDatasourceAccessorTest, when some code/classloader attempts to load javax.transaction.SystemException.
    - Caused by java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.transaction.SystemException
  - java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No class with name "javax.transaction.Transaction" found
    - Thrown from mockit internal class-loading logic when mockit tries to compute common superclasses while instrumentation/redefinition is performed.
  - java.lang.InternalError: class redefinition failed: invalid class
    - Raised by java.instrument during mockit retransformClasses call, triggered subsequently.

  - ... (mockit retransformClasses and other mockit internals)

Overall test summary at end of build:
- [ERROR] Errors: OpenEjbManagedDatasourceAccessorTest.getInfoTest, .canMapTest, .cannotMapTest (3 errors)
- BUILD FAILURE for psi-probe-core, causing whole build to fail.

Relevant Code Snippets (from the diff)
1) pom.xml changes that likely triggered the missing class situation (removed persistence/openejb version lines, added tomee, changed openejb dependency layout):

- Removed openejb.version and persistence.version, added tomee.version:
  - (diff excerpt)
    - -        <openejb.version>8.0.16</openejb.version>
    - -        <persistence.version>2.2.3</persistence.version>
    +        <tomee.version>8.0.16</tomee.version>

- Removed jakarta.persistence dependency block (note: jakarta.persistence provided javax <-> jakarta package mapping changed):
  - diff shows the following block removed (paraphrased):
    - Removed dependency:
      - groupId: org.eclipse.persistence
      - artifactId: jakarta.persistence
      - version: ${persistence.version}

- Added Tomee / OpenEJB dependencies (but with exclusions):
  - Added:
    - <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.tomee</groupId>
        <artifactId>openejb-api</artifactId>
        <version>${tomee.version}</version>
        <exclusions> ... </exclusions>
      </dependency>
    - <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.tomee</groupId>
        <artifactId>openejb-core</artifactId>
        <version>${tomee.version}</version>
        <exclusions>
          <exclusion><groupId>*</groupId><artifactId>*</artifactId></exclusion>
        </exclusions>
      </dependency>
    - plus openejb-loader and tomee-jdbc dependencies were added.

2) Tests were modified to import different pooling libs (many test files switched from ComboPooledDataSource to HikariDataSource), but the failing tests are in the OpenEJB area.

Why this is causing the observed failures
- The errors indicate that code or test code attempts to load classes from package javax.transaction.* (javax.transaction.SystemException, javax.transaction.Transaction) but those classes are not present on the test classpath.
- The pom changes removed or altered dependencies that previously supplied the javax.transaction API (or related libraries). The project still includes jakarta.transaction-api (if present) — but jakarta.transaction packages are jakarta.transaction.*, not javax.transaction.*. Tests and/or OpenEJB-managed classes are expecting the legacy javax.transaction package names, hence ClassNotFoundException.
- mockit instrumentation tries to inspect / retransform classes and compute common superclasses; while doing so, it tries to load javax.transaction.Transaction and fails, causing IllegalArgumentException and subsequent instrumentation InternalError (class redefinition failed).

Suggested Patches / Fixes
1) Quick patch (recommended, minimal change)
- Add the legacy javax.transaction API artifact so tests that reference javax.transaction.* compile and run.
- Edit pom.xml (likely in the top-level pom or psi-probe-core pom) and add:

  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.transaction</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.transaction-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.3</version> <!-- or 1.3.3 if you prefer -->
    <scope>test</scope> <!-- or provided if the runtime container supplies it; test will get it onto the test classpath -->
  </dependency>

- Place this dependency in the module where OpenEjbManagedDatasourceAccessorTest runs (psi-probe-core). Alternatively add it to the parent pom so all modules see it.
- Rationale: The tests (and mockit) are trying to load javax.transaction classes; adding the legacy API artifact restores those classes on the test classpath and removes the ClassNotFoundException and mockit redefinition cascade.

2) Better/longer-term alternatives
- Migrate the OpenEJB / code/tests to use jakarta.transaction.* instead of javax.transaction.* (major refactor).
  - This requires updating code, tests, and mocking expectations to use jakarta.* package names and ensuring all dependencies (OpenEJB/Tomee artifacts) use the Jakarta namespace.
- If moving to jakarta packages, ensure all libraries (OpenEJB/Tomee) and test code are consistent with Jakarta EE namespaces (note — migration is non-trivial).
- Alternatively, add a compatibility bridge that provides javax.* classes mapped to jakarta.* equivalents (but adding the javax.transaction-api artifact is the simpler and safe bridging approach in test scope).

3) Fix exclusions/packaging in the new Tomee/openejb dependency additions
- The diff shows openejb-core was added with a broad wildcard exclusion (exclusion of <groupId>*<artifactId>*). That's very suspicious — it effectively excludes almost everything from that dependency's transitive set and might have removed the previously available javax.transaction classes. Review and tighten exclusions to exclude only intended modules (rather than wildcard).
- Example: revert wildcard exclusions and only exclude specific artifacts known to cause conflicts (commons-logging, slf4j-jdk14, etc.) — do not exclude the core JTA API packages.

Concrete patch suggestion (example snippet to add to psi-probe-core/pom.xml or parent pom):
- Add under <dependencies> (preferably in psi-probe-core where tests run):

  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.transaction</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.transaction-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.3</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>

- Or, if the runtime container will provide the API in production, use <scope>provided</scope> instead of test.

Notes and Rationale
- The build errors clearly show mockit failing when trying to inspect types that are not available due to package/name differences. Since the failing name is javax.transaction.SystemException and javax.transaction.Transaction, and the diff replaced/removed persistence/openejb artifacts while introducing Tomee in a way that altered transitive dependencies, the fastest fix is to reintroduce the javax.transaction API artifact on the test classpath.
- The diff also shows multiple other dependency and code changes (byte-buddy, jmockit version tweaks, adding openejb-api/openejb-core/openejb-loader, switching tests to Hikari, etc.) — if additional failing tests surface after solving the javax.transaction missing class, similar dependency/classpath fixes or test updates may be necessary.
- Avoid using wildcard exclusions in the openejb/openejb-core dependency — it is likely to remove important transitive dependencies unexpectedly, including APIs used by tests.

Follow-up actions / checks
- After adding the javax.transaction-api dependency (or correcting openejb exclusions), run:
  - ./mvnw -T1C test -DskipITs (or simply ./mvnw test) and confirm OpenEjbManagedDatasourceAccessorTest passes and mockit does not throw redefinition errors.
- Review other tests that were previously passing — the pom changes are broad and may have removed other transitive APIs; run the full test suite to confirm.
- If the project intends to adopt Jakarta namespace (jakarta.transaction.*) across the codebase, schedule a dedicated codemod and dependency migration (this is a broader change).

If you want, I can:
- Produce the exact patch (pom.xml fragment) to add the javax.transaction-api dependency in the proper module (parent vs psi-probe-core).
- Inspect the openejb/openejb-core exclusion list in more detail and propose a corrected exclusions block that retains JTA API classes.
