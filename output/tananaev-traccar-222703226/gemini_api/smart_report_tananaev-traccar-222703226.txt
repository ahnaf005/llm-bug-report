## Bug Report: Build Failure - Checkstyle UnusedImports Violation Despite Import Removal

### 1. Title
Build Failure: Checkstyle UnusedImports Violation in `ReportUtils.java` Despite Import Removal

### 2. Steps to Reproduce
1.  Clone the `traccar` repository.
2.  Checkout the specific commit identified as `failed_sha`: `136a302846ad340f6babaa5f0f35018d867f73e8`.
3.  Execute the Maven build command: `mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V`

### 3. Triggering Input
The Checkstyle plugin (version 2.17) configured with the `checkstyle.xml` ruleset, when executed against the source file `src/org/traccar/reports/ReportUtils.java` at commit `136a302846ad340f6babaa5f0f35018d867f73e8`.

### 4. Expected Behavior
The Maven build should complete successfully without any Checkstyle violations. The provided code diff indicates that the `org.traccar.helper.Log` import, which was previously unused, is explicitly removed in commit `136a302846ad340f6babaa5f0f35018d867f73e8`. Therefore, Checkstyle should not report an `UnusedImports` violation for this specific import.

### 5. Observed Behavior
The Maven build fails with a Checkstyle `UnusedImports` violation. The error message explicitly states that `org.traccar.helper.Log` is an unused import in `src/org/traccar/reports/ReportUtils.java` at line 29, column 8. This contradicts the provided code diff, which shows that this exact import statement was removed in the commit being built (`136a302846ad340f6babaa5f0f35018d867f73e8`). This suggests a potential issue with the build environment, Checkstyle's analysis, or file synchronization during the build process.

### 6. Relevant Code Snippets
The following diff shows the removal of the `org.traccar.helper.Log` import in `src/org/traccar/reports/ReportUtils.java` between the `passed_sha` (`a1d91f3b8a80758d5f3e7804afec66256ab27e68`) and the `failed_sha` (`136a302846ad340f6babaa5f0f35018d867f73e8`):

### 8. Patches / Suggested Fixes
The provided code diff already includes the logical fix for the reported Checkstyle violation by removing the unused import `org.traccar.helper.Log` from `src/org/traccar/reports/ReportUtils.java`.

The actual bug appears to be a discrepancy between the code state that Checkstyle is analyzing and the code state checked out by `git` for the `failed_sha`.
Suggested actions:
*   Investigate the build environment to ensure that `git checkout` operations are fully and correctly applied before Checkstyle runs.
*   Check for any caching mechanisms in the Maven or Checkstyle configuration that might be causing an outdated version of the file to be analyzed.
*   Verify the Checkstyle plugin's configuration and its interaction with the Maven build lifecycle.
