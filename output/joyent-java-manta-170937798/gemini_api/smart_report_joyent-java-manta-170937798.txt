## Bug Report: Checkstyle Violation - Missing `package-info.java`

### 1. Title
Build Fails Due to Checkstyle `JavadocPackage` Violation: Missing `package-info.java` in `com.joyent.manta.client.multipart`

### 2. Steps to Reproduce
1.  Clone the `joyent/java-manta` repository.
2.  Checkout the commit `a61829b9dbcc2195859716d626ca09a828c3a2d4`.
3.  Ensure Java 8 and Maven 3.2.5 are installed and configured.
4.  Navigate to the `joyent/java-manta` directory.
5.  Execute the Maven build command: `mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V`

### 3. Triggering Input
The build is triggered by the Maven `install` goal, which includes the `checkstyle:check` goal. The `JavadocPackage` Checkstyle rule is configured to require a `package-info.java` file for all packages. The `com.joyent.manta.client.multipart` package is missing this file.

### 4. Expected Behavior
The Maven build should complete successfully, indicating that all code quality checks, including Checkstyle, have passed.

### 5. Observed Behavior
The Maven build fails with a `MojoFailureException` from the `maven-checkstyle-plugin`. The specific error reported is a `JavadocPackage` violation, indicating that the `package-info.java` file is missing for the `com.joyent.manta.client.multipart` package. The build attempts to retry but fails consistently.

**Error Message:**
```
[ERROR] src/main/java/com/joyent/manta/client/multipart/MantaMultipartManager.java:[0] (javadoc) JavadocPackage: Missing package-info.java file.
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (checkstyle) on project java-manta-client: You have 1 Checkstyle violation. -> [Help 1]
```

### 6. Relevant Code Snippets
The build log indicates the error originates from the `com.joyent.manta.client.multipart` package, specifically referencing `MantaMultipartManager.java` as the file within that package that triggered the check.

The relevant code snippet from the diff that *resolves* this issue is the addition of the `package-info.java` file:

```diff
